        <p>In real life, The Military Leaders Kenshin Uesugi and Shingen Takeda were fierce rivals. In the battle of Kawanakajima, Uesugi lead a surprise attack on Takeda. At the time, Takeda only had his warfan to protect himself. He was then later saved by his vassal Yukimura Sanada. The legend has since been retold many, many times and eventually made its way to Samurai Warriors</p>

    <div class="column">
        <p style="text-align: right;">In the game, Koei Tecmo decided to represent this by having Takeda's main weapon be the warfan and the symbolism goes further than that. Uesugi's main weapon is a sword, but the special thing about this sword is that it has 7 protruding edges on it. Legend has it that Takeda was able to deflect three blows before being rescued and the fan was left with 7 notches on it.</p>
